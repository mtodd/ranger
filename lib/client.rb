module Ranger
  
  # = Client
  # 
  # The client interface for accessing services provided by the Halcyon
  # application as defined in the controllers in <tt>app/</tt>.
  # 
  # == Usage
  # 
  # To use the Client in your application, create an instance and call methods
  # defined here. For example:
  # 
  #   client = Ranger::Client.new('http://localhost:4647/')
  #   client.time #=> "Tue Apr 15 21:04:15 -0400 2008"
  # 
  # You can just as easily call the primary <tt>get</tt>, <tt>post</tt>,
  # <tt>put</tt>, and <tt>delete</tt> methods as well, passing in the +path+
  # and any params. For example:
  # 
  #   client.get('/time') #=> "Tue Apr 15 21:04:15 -0400 2008"
  # 
  # By default, if you enter a bad (non-existent) path or the application
  # raises an exception and cannot complete successfully, the standard response
  # format will be returned but with more appropriate +status+ and +body+
  # values. For instance:
  # 
  #   client.get('/nonexistent/path') #=> {:status=>404,:body=>"Not Found"}
  # 
  # Exceptions can be raised on any +status+ returned other than +200+ if you
  # set <tt>Halcyon::Client#raise_exceptions!</tt> to +true+ (which is the
  # default param).
  # 
  #   client.raise_exceptions! #=> true
  #   client.get('/nonexistent/path') #=> NotFound exception is raised
  # 
  # These exceptions all inherit from <tt>Halcyon::Exceptions::Base</tt> so
  # <tt>rescue</tt>ing just normal Halcyon errors is trivial.
  # 
  # However, setting this value can cause the meaning and the appropriate
  # error-handling measures put in place in actions. Although each method
  # could just as easily set the +raise_exceptions+ configuration option
  # itself, it is not advised to do so due to the possibility of non-
  # consistent and confusing behavior it can cause.
  # 
  # If raising exceptions is preferred, it should be set as soon as the
  # client is created and the client methods should be designed accordingly.
  class Client < Halcyon::Client
    
    def self.version
      VERSION.join('.')
    end
    
    # Sample of a client method to wrap an API call
    def time
      get('/time')[:body]
    end
    
    # More comprehensive sample client method
    def strftime(format = nil)
      if (res = post('/time', :format => format))[:status] == 200
        # success
        res[:body]
      else
        # failure
        # returns the whole response to indicate an error happened, but could
        # just as easily raise an exception.
        # but if an exception is prefererd, read the documentation for
        # <tt>Halcyon::Client#raise_exceptions!</tt> instead.
        res
